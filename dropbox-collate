#   Foo Bar - blah blah.png

# or whatever.  Foo Bar---the part up to the first hyphen---is taken
# as the name of a student.  For each such unique student name, a
# directory is created, and all files beginning with that student name
# are moved into the corresponding directory.
#
# In particular this is how files from a DropBox file request come.
#
# Correctly handles (1) student names with apostrophes, (2) multiple
# spaces between names (e.g. 'Sam Smith' and 'Sam Smith' are
# considered the same).

# Create directories based on student names
